### Function
The program will show the remaining battery percentage on the taskbar.

### Features
1. Use different transparent icons for different percentages, thus looks more harmonious with the task bar (it has no black background).
2. It will **automatically switch icon color** when user change to Light/Dark mode. ✨
3. It's **event driven**. No timer & scanning.
4. It will notify users when the battery life is less than 25% or the battery is fully charged
