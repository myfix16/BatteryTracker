### Function
The program will show remaining battery percentage on the task bar.
### Features

2. It will **automatically switch icon color** when user change to Light/Dark mode. ✨
3. It's **event driven**. No timer & scanning. You can find scanning version from [here](https://github.com/myfix16/BatteryTracker).
